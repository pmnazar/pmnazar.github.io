        <description><![CDATA[This reconstruction of medieval shoreline is based on the plans of Bartolomeo Capasso, Topografia della città di Napoli nell' XI Secolo (Naples: 1895; reprint, Arnaldo Forni, 2005); and the detailed map, "Pianta di Napoli Greco-Romana" (1904) in his Napoli Greco-Romana (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/82905189) (Naples: L. Pierro & Figlio,1905). This has been updated and corrected in Mario Napoli, "La città," Storia di Napoli (1969) 2.2:770–72; and Cesare De Seta, Napoli fra Rinascimento e Illuminismo (Naples: Electa, 1997), esp. p. 17. <br><br><br>The shoreline and the port area have been reconstructed from the archival record by Amadeo Feniello, "Contributo alla storia della 'Iunctura civitatis' (Secc. X-XIII), in Ricerche sul medioevo napoletano. Aspetti e momenti della vita economica e sociale a Napoli tra X e XV secolo, ed. A. Leone, Gabriele Capone et al. (Naples: Athena, 1996).<br><br>These documentary sources have also recently been enriched by the archaeological finds coming out of the Metropolitana excavations at Piazza Nicola Amore and Piazza Bovio.

        <name>Medieval / Norman Wall</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The line of the walls of medieval Naples is not certain. As for most historical plans of medieval Naples, this reconstruction of the walls as they existed by the 11th century, during the Norman and then Hohenstaufen periods, is based on Bartolomeo Capasso,Napoli Greco-Romano (Naples: Società Napoletana di Storia Patria, 1905, reprint Naples: Arturo Berisio Editore, 1987), map; Bartolomeo Capasso, Topografia della Città di Napoli nell' XI Secolo (Naples: 1895; reprint, Arnaldo Forni, 2005). For later work see Mario Napoli, “La città,” Storia di Napoli 2.2 (1969): “La cinta urbana,” 739–52; Lucio Santoro, Le mura di Napoli (Rome: Ist. Italiano dei Castelli, 1984). This has been updated and corrected in Cesare De Seta, Napoli fra Rinascimento e Illuminismo (Naples: Electa, 1997), esp. p. 17; and in Paul Arthur, Naples: From Roman Town to City-State (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51107768) (London: The British School at Rome, 2002), 35–37.<br><br><br>Recent research, occasioned by construction excavations on Naples' new Metropolitana subway branch, has unearthed evidence of the medieval walls that may change the dating on the southeast expansion of the city, around Piazza del Mercato, to the late Hohenstaufen, rather than the early Angevin, period.

        <description><![CDATA[This reconstruction of the Angevin walls is based on Arnaldo Venditti, "Urbanistica e architettura angioina. 2. La struttura della città e la cinta muraria," in Ernesto Pontieri, ed., Storia di Napoli 3 (Naples: Società Editrice Storia di Napoli, 1969), p. 668-71; Cesare De Seta, Napoli fra Rinascimento e Illuminismo (Naples: Electa, 1997), 1-54, esp. p. 17; and Cesare De Seta, La città nella storia d'Italia: Napoli (Rome & Bari: Laterza, 1991), p. 36-38.  For later work see Lucio Santoro, Le mura di Napoli (Rome: Ist. Italiano dei Castelli, 1984). Recent research, occasioned by construction excavations on Naples' new Metropolitana subway branch, has unearthed evidence of the medieval walls that may change the dating on the southeast expansion of the city, around Piazza del Mercato, to the late Hohenstaufen, rather than the early Angevin, period. Evidence remains inconclusive to date, however.]]></description>

Thirteen meters directly under the present piazza and 3.5 meters beneath modern sea level, the remains include 4 ships dating from the Roman period, coins, shoes and ceramics, including remains of North African manufacture. The discovery begins to settle one of the longest outstanding questions about the ancient and early medieval city.<br><br><br>The excavations appear to confirm the hypothesis put forward by Capasso at the turn of the last century concerning the location of the ancient harbor. See Bartolomeo Capasso, Topografia della Città di Napoli nell' XI Secolo (Naples: 1895; reprint, Arnaldo Forni, 2005), pp. 28-29, and Pianta di Napoli del Secolo XI; as updated and corrected in Mario Napoli, "La città," Storia di Napoli (1969) 2.2:770–72; and Cesare De Seta, Napoli fra Rinascimento e Illuminismo (Naples: Electa, 1997), p. 15, 30, 46.<br><br><br>Capasso had also originally speculated that late ancient and Byzantine Naples had two ports,"de illu Arcina," the origin of the Arsenale, and"Bulpanum" or Vulpulum. More recent scholarship has tentatively concluded that these were two names for the same port area; but the latest excavations may yet bear out Capasso's speculation on this as well.<br><br><br>For further details on the dig see: Archaeology (http://archive.archaeology.org/0805/etc/naples.html) 61.3 (June 2008); and the blog of Prof. Rabun Taylor (https://webspace.utexas.edu/rt7395/www/personal%20website/Naples%20project.html), along with Joseph Alchermes, one of the authors of the next projected volume of A Documentary History of Naples (http://www.italicapress.com/index128.html): Ancient Naples.]]></description>

In 1381 the castle was occupied by the forces of Charles III of Durazzo in his final campaign against Giovanna I; in 1390 by the forces of Louis II of Anjou during his attempt to claim the city; and again in 1442 by the last of the Angevins, René of Anjou, in his conflict against Alfonso of Aragon.<br><br><br>The French invasion led by Odette de Lautrec in 1528 convinced the Spanish under viceroy Pedro de Toledo to vastly enlarge and improve the fortification (1537-46).

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/80499896@N05/sets/72157630153362290)<br><br><br><br>Castel dell'Ovooccupies the most ancient site in all of Naples: the location of the Greek colony of Megaris on a small island connected to the modern city by a narrow causeway.<br> <br>During the Roman Empire it was the location of the famous villa of Lucullus, remains of which are still visible in the lower basements of the fortress. <br> <br>The villa saw the last act of the western Roman Empire: in 476 CE the puppet ruler Romulus Augustulus was deposed and then imprisoned here by the Ostrogoth ruler Odoacer and probably died here.<br> <br>The villa became the site of the monastery of San Salvatore of Basilian (Greek) monks in the early Middle Ages. This grew up next to a Byzantine castrum or castellum of Naples’ dukes. Emperor Valentinian had fortified the villa of Lucullus c.440. In 482 the remains of St. Severinus of Noricum were brought here from the former Danube frontier. <br><br>There is some doubt as to the actual location of the castrum and the monasteries. Nicola Cilento, “La chiesa di Napoli nell‘alto medioevo,” Storia di Napoli (1969) 2.2:641–735, at pp. 658–59, notes that there were several villas in addition to that of Lucullus in the vicinity, and that these may have been transformed into several of the early medieval monasteries founded there. That founded by followers of St. Severinus of Noricum seems to have been the forerunner of the ninth-century monastery “del Salvatore” or in insula maris. This monastery was noted, like Cassiodorus‘ Vivarium, for its scriptorium, which had a direct impact on Lindisfarne and its famous Gospels book.<br><br>Mario Napoli, “La città,” Storia di Napoli (1969) 2.2:737–72, at pp. 679–80, indicates that the actual castrum Lucullanum rose atop the hill of Pizzofalcone, adjacent to the Megaride island, and that on the island are the remains of both the monasteries of St. Severinus and of San Salvatore. It is these latter remains that are still visible on the lower levels of the Castel dell‘Ovo, incorporated into the Norman castle. <br><br> Arnaldo Venditti, “L‘architettura dell‘alto medioevo,” Storia di Napoli (1969) 2.2:773–876, at pp. 836–40, concurs with Napoli, and contends, following Capasso, that the castrum Lucullanum was more like an oppidum, or fortified town, covering most of Pizzofalcone and extending as far as the present Castel Nuovo. Venditti agrees that San Salvatore was on the Megaride island from at least the seventh centiry, and he presents a tentative reconstruction plan of the site (p. 840).<br><br>Paul Arthur, Naples: From Roman Town to City-State (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51107768) (London: The British School at Rome, 2002), 69–71, synthesizes these findings and notes that the topography of the area has, indeed, shifted considerably over the centuries: both the island and the hill of Pizzofalcone changing size and shape. The original villa of Lucullus may, in fact, have spanned both island and hillside. The Byzantine and later ducal castrum appears to have risen atop the crest of Pizzofalcone, while the seventh-century monastery of San Salvatore rose on the island atop the foundations of the hermitage of St. Severinus, founded c.492. Excavations carried out on the site in 1924/25 discovered a series of caves or cells, and a rectangular hall, most likely a refectory, supported by the twelve reused Roman columns still visible on the lower levels of the castle.<br><br>In 902, fearing conquest by the Saracens, the Neapolitans destroyed the castrum and the monastery of San Salvatore on the Megaride island, and the monks moved to what would become the monastery of SS. Severino e Sossio inside the walls of Naples.<br> <br>The island had been refortified by at least 1128; and when Naples fell to the new Norman kingdom in 1139, the Norman kings expanded the site and made it a royal residence.<br> <br>Emperor Frederick II made the castle his own]]></description>

The area that the castle occupies was called the campus oppidi and lay outside the Porta de Vulpulum along the "platea di porto pisano." It had already been the site of some settlement and ecclesiastical structures, including a new Franciscan house, Sta. Maria di Palazzo, that occupied the ruins of an ancient Roman villa. These were demolished and the Franciscan community moved to San Lorenzo Maggiore within Naples.<br> <br>The castle as it exists today is largely the work of Alfonso of Aragaon after he conquered the kingdom in 1442. The Aragonese rebuilt the massive rounded towers that we see today, and added the triumphal arch between 1454 and 1467 to commemorate Alfonso's formal entry into the city.<br> <br>A little of the interior retains the work of the Angevin period, including the Capella Palatina (Sta. Barbara) from 1307, which was completely redecorated by Giotto c. 1330, perhaps according to a scheme laid out by Francesco Petrarca in his Triumphs, in order to celebrate the upcoming betrothal of Princess Giovanna (Giovanna I) to her Hungarian cousin Andrew in August 1342.<br>The second major late medieval monument is the Sala dei Baroni, a huge Gothic hall with a central rib-vaulted ceiling. In addition, King Robert the Wise first laid out the gardens that stretch to the west of the castle and the harbor.<br> <br>Under the Angevins the castle became the chief royal residence and center of court life: here Petrarch, Boccaccio, numerous academics, visual artists and religious figures shared in the patronage of King Robert and Queen Sancia. Here too the royal couple hosted a community of dissident, Spiritual Franciscans, often in outright defiance of the pope. In fact, the castle had seen the abdication of the Spirituals' hero, Pope Celestine V, here in December 1294. <br> <br>A generation later, it was the scene of the siege of Queen Giovanna I and her court under the attacks of her royal cousins and the pope in 1346 after she was accused (falsely) of murdering her husband. Here also Emperor Charles V resided in 1535-36 on his return from the crusade in Tunisia.<br> <br>Today the castle remains a public facility, housing a civic museum of Naples, the city council chamber (in the Sala dei Baroni), the Campania regional council and the Società Napoletana di Storia Patria.<br> <br>See Paul Blanchard, Blue Guide: Southern Italy (New York: W.W.

These contain a number of important early Christian wall paintings and mosaics. By the end of the third century, especially after the death of S. Agrippino, the catacombs had become important religious centers of the city, though the suggestion of some Neapolitan authors that these presented the first places of worship seems most improbable. The sites were marked by several churches, the most important of which was a funerary basilica dedicated first to S. Agrippino and later to S. Gennaro, the patron saint of Naples martyred during the persecutions of Diocletian. This church maintains some of its original masonry, in spite of successive reconstructions and additions.<br><br>Wall paintings and later burials dating to the tenth and possibly the eleventh century attest to the continued use of the catacombs as a place of pilgrimage and entombment, activities no doubt promoted by the Benedictine abbey established at the site.<br><br>From Caroline Bruzelius, "Art, Architecture and Urbanism in Naples," in Enrico Bacco, Naples: An Early Guide (http://www.italicapress.com/index069.html) (New York: Italica Press, 1991), p.  lxviii-lxix.<br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wognUbPV9-v5pFQWe7K0Kxbn_GnQ2G2ppn-wxeoMIOHK56lh9UVVC4c5FHaSiW8tsMhzPz2m4Kf2_QVe2iTZbmtKogZ-_HjpuK5dNQslFaIPbRVpMw4zh1HKhk6v5BT6cx8rTZKG3A9Ik2k" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/80499896@N05/sets/72157630152316564)<br><br>Charles II’s patronage in Naples, however, had a special character. The first project to be undertaken, in June, 1294, was at the instigation of Archbishop Filippo Minutolo: the reconstruction of the cathedral. The axis of the old basilica was swiveled ninety degrees, so that the new apse was in the east (Fig. xx). Part of the old church was absorbed into the much larger building - it would appear, in fact, that the width of the nave, aisles and lateral chapels of the new cathedral correspond to the dimensions of the atrium in front of Sta. Restituta. <br><br>The new cathedral is thus parallel to Via dei Tribunali, rather than at right angles to it, as its predecessor had been. The new orientation of the church permitted a much larger and longer structure, truly a monumental cathedral suitable to the new capital of the Kingdom, but the site did have the disadvantage that the south flank of the new cathedral ran along a fault line, a problem that was to cause a series of structural failures in centuries to come. <br><br>The new church was also radically different in plan. It had a tall, uninterrupted transept modeled on monuments such as the Early Christian basilicas of Rome (there was no transept at Sta. Restituta). Romano and Bruzelius have observed that the romanitas of the design of the new cathedral may have reflected a cult of the sacred and ancient origins of the episcopacy of Naples, according to legend founded by Saint Peter. <br><br>These ideas are reflected in the dedications and decoration of the Minutolo and D’Ormont chapels, founded in ca. 1300 and ca. 1315 respectively, and dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. 25 An interest in historical continuity and tradition are also revealed in the design of the piers, which integrate the ancient columns from the atrium into their structure (Fig. xx). The columns were inserted into semi-circular concavities in the lower part of each pier, creating a vertical accent that was then continued in the upper part of the piers by a shaft constructed in coursed masonry. <br><br>This unusual arrangement has counterparts in Campanian Romanesque architecture: columns are inserted into the crossing piers at the cathedrals of Caserta Vecchia, Aversa, and Sessa Aurunca. In Naples, though, this idea is extended throughout the entire church, and provided a way for ancient columns to be used even in architecture on a much taller and grander scale than the preceding building. <br><br>The integration of columns into the piers thus recalls the long tradition of Early Christian basilicas, but at the same time they did not impose limitations on the height and scale of the new building. This was an important innovation in a city where - unlike Rome - there was a shortage of monumentally scaled columns available. The central point here, however, is the affinity between the new Cathedral of Naples and the great Constantinian basilicas of Rome, evoked in somewhat modernized, “Gothic” form.  <br><br>—Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

Here the royal family also hosted the tournaments that Boccaccio records and for which Naples became famous. <br><br>Along the Largo were also established important government offices, hospitals, the church of Sta.

In 1284, Charles II, while still Prince of Salerno, made a major donation for the construction of a new and much larger church. <br> <br>The monastic complex was rebuilt in the Aragonese period, however, and the church, badly damaged by earthquakes and heavily restored on several occasions, is covered by a thick layer of stucco and “medievalizing” decoration of the middle of the nineteenth century. <br> <br>Only the main portal (located on the north) attests to the refinement and elegance of the original medieval building; it was a donation of the heir to the throne, Charles of Calabria in 1325. The utilization of two colors of marble to create a refined intarsia pattern is highly unusual in Naples, and relates most closely to the portals of the Baptistery of Siena Cathedral, dated to the 1320s.<br><br>— Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/80499896@N05/sets/72157630169072410)<br><br>The only surviving twelfth century church, S. Giovanni a Mare, attests precisely to this sort of blending of old and new, of local and imported ideas. The foundation belonged to the Knights Hospitaler, but no documents survive or their arrival or of the foundation of the church and the contiguous hospital. The first attestation of the community is a financial bequest in a document of 1186. It is likely that by this time the church had been erected, though the absence of surviving comparative monuments and the character of the building render a precise dating difficult. <br> <br>The nave consists of five bays of groin vaults supported by re-used ancient columns, terminating in a wide transept. The original semi-circular apse was replaced by ca. 1300 if not earlier by a second transept and by three rectangular eastern chapels. The nave arcade is supported by handsome re-used columns and capitals, and fragments of a Roman architrave also frame the original chancel arch at its termination. <br> <br>The entire interior is groin-vaulted, which is an unusual disposition over columns but not unknown in Campania, especially in the context of crypts. This was possible because of the small dimensions of the interior vessels. The irregular dimensions of the three eastern rectangular chapels seem to have been determined by restraints imposed by previous structures outside the church to the east, but of these (hospital?) structures nothing survives except for an eastern hall, reconstructed in the late 15th or 16th century (now a textile wholesale store, but formerly perhaps a ward of the twelfth-century hospital). The Angevin expansion of the east end, repairs to the building after the earthquake of 1456, the addition of lateral chapels along the nave, and, finally, the present coating of plaster and whitewash, prohibit a more detailed analysis of the chronology of this strikingly beautiful and interesting church, but in the essential elements of the structure it can be compared to the nave and aisles of the cathedrals of Carinola or Sessa Aurunca, both in Campania and dating to the early twelfth century.<br> <br>S. Giovanni a Mare attests to the community of foreign travelers, merchants and new religious groups who worked in or passed through the commercial area outside the walls near the port. <br>— Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

Giovanni." It may have been part of a larger urban development plan that enclosed the southeastern part of the city toward the harbor in new walls. It contains a reconsecration stone from the reign of Pope Silvester II (992–1003).<br><br><br>The present basilica traces the foundations of the early-Christian church, but it dates from its rebuilding in 1685 by Dionisio Lazzari and restoration in 1872-88. The church was closed in 2000 for a complete restoration (completed 2003/4) and for archaeological digs on the site. The latter have not yet been published. <br><br>The medieval survivals include a small section of floor mosaics (approximately 0.5 meter sq.) and the form of its early Christian ambulatory, which includes a detached column to the north of the present apse and two complete pairings of a pilaster and fluted column, which supported the ambulatory arcade.

He was also, however, an active patron of religious foundations, in Lucera and Barletta as well as in Naples, and seems to have had special veneration for Peter of Morrone, who became Pope Celestine V and abdicated the papal throne while in Naples in 1294. Peter of Morrone had founded a reform branch of the Benedictines, the Celestinians, who were known for their asceticism. <br><br>The location of the church, pressed between the west end of the Via dei Tribunali and extant buildings to the south, has the primary structural characteristics of the many major churches erected by Charles II (the cathedrals of Naples, and Lucera, San Domenico in Naples): compound piers with attached shafts for the arcade arches and ribs of the side-aisles, an upper nave wall that is entirely flat, punctuated only by the windows of the clerestory, and covered with a wooden truss ceiling. <br><br>The limpid geometry of the interior surfaces of these churches would have been evident at the Cathedral and San Domenico in Naples before subsequent redecoration and remodeling, and this kind of treatment of the interior is still visible at the Cathedral of Lucera.<br><br>— Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/80499896@N05/sets/72157630166265640)<br><br>Sant’Eligio is the most “purely French” architectural structure of Angevin Naples. The church was begun soon after Charles I’s donation of land in 1270, as the battered capitals and architectural details of the nave interior, as well as the portal on the south flank, are closely related to French models of the third quarter of the 13th century.  <br><br>However, the church underwent many changes while construction was underway: the planned rib vaults were never installed, the westernmost bay expands the dimensions of those to the east, and the original apse was replaced by a transept and new apses after a second donation of land by King Charles in 1279 (excavations undertaken after World War II revealed the original apse, but no records of this discovery remain ( Fig (http://gallery.mac.com/rgmusto#100069).).  <br><br>The western bay antedates the reconstruction of the east end, because it was also intended rib-vaulted, whereas the addition of the transept was not designed for rib vaults (Fig (http://gallery.mac.com/rgmusto#100069).).   Indeed in the high, uninterrupted volume of the transept is similar to structures of the 1290s, such as the Cathedral of Naples, begun 1294; this, in combination with other architectural details, suggest that construction at the hospital church may have been severely interrupted by the War of 1282 (the War of the Sicilian Vespers), which  appears to have interfered with the completion of any number of building projects initiated in the 1270s. <br><br>In the middle of the fourteenth century, and probably after the earthquake of 1349, the closely-spaced compound piers of Sant’Eligio were replaced by fewer, larger, and more broadly-spaced piers of grey piperno, a harder, granite-like stone more resistant to weight and stress than the softer tuff originally used (Fig (http://gallery.mac.com/rgmusto#100069).).   <br><br>The form of these piers recalls the simple polygonal supporting elements that can be found in the mid-14th century monuments in southern and central France, for example at La Chaise Dieu in the Auvergne. The original piers would have consisted of a cluster of shafts intended to support a series of light ribs that probably had an identical section for both transverse and diagonal elements. This would have been similar to the vaults of Saint-Jean-de-Malte in Aix-en-Provence, built by Charles of Anjou in the 1270s for the burial of his first wife, Beatrice of Provence (d. 1267). Although the French church, attached to the convent and hospital of the Knights Hospitaler in Aix, originally had no aisles (the present chapels are later insertions), the treatment of the shafts and wall surfaces is close to what can be reconstructed of the original structure at Sant’Eligio in Naples. <br><br>The west façade of Sant’Eligio (to the extent that it was ever completed) is encased in apartment buildings and is no longer visible.  The portal on the south flank of the church, recently cleaned and restored,  is a remarkable example of up-to-date French workmanship of the highest order (Fig (http://gallery.mac.com/rgmusto#100069).). <br><br>The lush richly sculpted crockets, the high quality of the execution of the moldings and bases, are among the few surviving attestations of French workmanship in Naples.  “Northern” sources for Sant’Eligio are thus strongly confirmed in the design of the portal, in a pure Rayonnant style of the Ile-de-France; here the thick leaves and crockets in the archivolts, and the stiff and elegant jamb capitals, are reminiscent of the best quality Parisian work of the third quarter of the thirteenth century.  <br><br>Recent cleaning of the portal has revealed a novel feature, however: there is a band of white limestone between the darker peperino moldings of the innermost and outermost archivolts, an element not to our knowledge found in France.<br>— Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

Partly decorated by Giotto (1266?-1337), its original cycle of painted decoration, which probably strongly reflected the queen’s own pious concerns, was completely covered with baroque incrustations in the eighteenth century. <br><br>This church was also restored to an approximation of its original medieval appearance after World War II: the grand, severe interior volumes reflect on the one hand a dedication to the spirit of poverty espoused by St. Francis but on the other the need for a vast interior in which state occasions (funerals, coronations, etc.) could take place. <br><br>As protectors of the radical Franciscans known as the Spirituals, Queen Sancia and King Robert the Wise seem to have made the double convent of S. Chiara the center of religious dissent in Naples. Within the church, the double tomb of King Robert by Giovanni and Pacio Bertini (mid-fourteenth century) presides over the nave, while a single effigy of the king appears on the reverse of the same wall in the nun’s choir. The public monument, severely damaged in the bombardment and fire of 1943, presents at the top the king majestically enthroned; below is a recumbent barefoot effigy of Robert dressed in Franciscan habit. In this complex sepulchral monument the king’s role as a patron of the arts and learning is suggested by personifications of the Virtues, which support the sarcophagus, and the Seven Liberal Arts, which stand behind the effigy. The tomb of Robert is flanked to the right by that of his heir, Charles of Calabria, (d. 1328) whose wife, Mary of Valois (d. 1331), is buried adjacent to the entrance to the sacristy, and to the left by the tomb of Maria di Durazzo (d. 1366). <br><br>From Caroline Bruzelius, "Art, Architecture and Urbanism in Naples," in Enrico Bacco, Naples: An Early Guide (http://www.italicapress.com/index069.html) (New York: Italica Press, 1991), p.  lxxiii-lxxiv.

Chiara<br><br><br><br>From Il Monastero di Santa Chiara, 24.<br><br><br>Recent research has pointed to the existence of a small bath complex comprising two chambers (each c. 3 x 3 meters) on the southern perimeter of the Sta. Chiara complex, within one of the monastic buildings on the western side of the southernmost cloister, south of the monastic kitchens and refectory. At the time of its building the bath building lay outside the ancient and Byzantine walls, but near the old Roman baths, perhaps indicating some continuity within the area. The bath building appears to incorporate spolia from the Sta. Chiara Roman bath complex and both Byzantine and Muslim Umayyad stylistic elements, including a square, domed main chamber. It probably dates from some time in the later ducal period (Arthur dates it 11th c.) and has a parallel in a small bath complex of the 11th c. from the Crypta Balbi in Rome. <br><br><br>While the institution of the medieval bath in southern Italy often depended upon the support of monastic houses -- often in connection with diaconiae (perhaps here the predecessor of Sta. Chiara) -- this small complex remains one of the few secular buildings to survive almost intact from the ducal period and points to the continued cultural connections with the Byzantine and Muslim worlds. It also reinforces literary evidence of Naples' place within the surviving social and material forms of ancient bath culture.<br><br><br>See Il Monastero di Santa Chiara, ed.

The polygonal apse is preceded by a rectangular nave divided into two levels, the upper a choir reserved for the nuns, and the lower as a church open to the public. Groin vaults decorated with the painted arms of Anjou and Hungary support the upper gallery, and Mary of Hungary (d. 1325) is herself buried on the left side of the nave (it has been proposed that her tomb was originally located behind the altar in the apse).<br><br>Sta. Maria Donnaregina is now mostly known for the ambitious cycle of frescoes that decorate the nuns’ choir, a cycle attributed to the school or the circle of Pietro Cavallini. The program was badly damaged in a fire of the late fourteenth century, but is nonetheless a precious testament to the importance of northern artists at work in Naples in the first and second decades of the fourteenth century (the Donnaregina frescoes are generally dated to 1317-1319). Pietro Cavallini was already present in Naples in ca. 1308, when he probably decorated the Brancaccio Chapel at San Domenico.<br>— Caroline Bruzelius]]></description>

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/80499896@N05/sets/72157630165725336)<br><br>It was long believed that Queen Giovanna I founded this church in the 1350s atop a palace of justice that had been the residence of her father, Charles of Calabria. Ferdinando Bologna, working mostly from stylistic evidence and accounts by early modern historians, asserted that the church saw two major building campaigns and fresco cycles. The first, of Old Testament justice painted by Roberto di Oderisio c.1340–43 under King Robert, and a second of the sacraments also attributed to di Oderisio, dating from 1352–54 and commissioned by Queen Giovanna I. King Ladislao added a new fresco cycle to the church of the Incoronata depicting the life of his patron saint. <br><br>Despite the devastation of the largo itself by the Aragonese in 1442, that dynasty continued to use the church. But between 1503 and 1537 during the reign of<br>Emperor Charles V (1517–59), the expansion of Castel Nuovo’s bastions and moats had raised the ground level around the church by twelve feet and had diminished the importance of the largo overall. The church was then handed over to the Certosa di S. Martino, but by 1533 its monks were already in the process of abandoning the church and the neighboring hospital. By 1673 residents of the neighborhood, then known as via Medina, were officially protesting the construction of waterworks to feed nearby buildings that they said would “pose an obvious danger to the houses…and ruin their pavements. Above all, it would endanger the Cistercians’ church of the Incoronata, which, it is certain, would collapse in a few years” (S. Maria dell’Incoronata, 1673). <br><br>By 1692 Carlo Celano reported that the church and the hospital that surrounded it has been turned into wine shops and warehouses. Reconsecrated in 1732, it was heavily decorated in the baroque style. Stucco work covered its medieval fabric.<br>The Cistercians finally abandoned the building upon the suppression of their order in 1806. Though still accessible, by the nineteenth century the remains of the church had been incorporated into the ground floor and basement of an apartment building and essentially forgotten. The frescoes had nearly disappeared. A photograph taken in 1925 shows the church buried up to the springing of its external arcade, its walls covered with advertising posters, a huge marquee indicating that a dental laboratory now occupied the apartment building above it. <br><br>A photo from the mid-1950s shows a Cadillac and a Buick sedan amid the tiny Fiats parked outside the five-story apartment, Giovanna’s elegant arcade overshadowed by balconies, hanging laundry and shop awnings.<br><br>When this apartment building was finally demolished in 1961 to begin restorations, art historians and archeologists realized that much of the church would have to be reassembled. Its main portal was recovered from the cemetery of the old royal place of Poggioreale, itself destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II. Other elements of the external facade had to be reconstructed. Restoration was interrupted by the earthquake of November 1980 and completed in 1993. Only with this restoration was a new interpretation of the evidence for the church and its legacy attempted, by Lorenz Enderlein, in 1996. Using records in the Neapolitan Archivio di Stato, Enderlein was able to demonstrate conclusively, in thirty pages, that the legend about the church and its foundation, accepted for the past five hundred years, needed major revision. His documentary evidence, collaborated by more than one source, indicate that the church was actually founded and constructed by Giovanna between the late 1360s and 1374. HIs work has now been confirmed and expanded upon by Paola Vitolo, La chiesa della Regina (2008).
